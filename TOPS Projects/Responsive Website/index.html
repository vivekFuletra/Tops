            A child’s right to education entails the right to learn. Yet, for
            too many children across the globe, schooling does not lead to
            learning.

          Education transforms lives and is at the heart of UNESCO’s mission to
          build peace, eradicate poverty and drive sustainable development. It
          is a human right for all throughout life. The Organization is the only
          United Nations agency with a mandate to cover all aspects of
          education. It has been entrusted to lead the Global Education 2030
          Agenda through Sustainable Development Goal 4.UNESCO provides global
          and regional leadership in education, strengthens education systems
          worldwide and responds to contemporary global challenges through
          education with gender equality as an underlying principle. Its work
          encompasses quality educational development from pre-school to higher
          education and beyond. Education originated as the transmission of
          cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational
          goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of
          learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex
          vocational skills.

          One of the most significant phenomena of the 20th century was the
          dramatic expansion and extension of public (i.e.,
          government-sponsored) education systems around the world—the number of
          schools grew, as did the number of children attending them. Similarly,
          the subjects taught in schools broadened from the basics of
          mathematics and language to include sciences and the arts. Various
          explanations have been given for the substantial increase in numbers
          of youths as well as adults attending government-sponsored schools;
          social scientists tend to categorize the reasons for these enrollment
          increases as products of either conflict or consensus in the process
          of social change. In most cases these perspectives are rooted in
          theories of social science that were formulated in the late 19th and
          early 20th centuries. As societies grow more complex, however, the
          quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one generation to the next
          becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must
          evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission.
          The outcome is formal education—the school and the specialist called
          the teacher.

          The term education can be applied to primitive cultures only in the
          sense of enculturation, which is the process of cultural transmission.
          A primitive person, whose culture is the totality of his universe, has
          a relatively fixed sense of cultural continuity and timelessness. The
          model of life is relatively static and absolute, and it is transmitted
          from one generation to another with little deviation. As for
          prehistoric education, it can only be inferred from educational
          practices in surviving primitive cultures. As society becomes ever
          more complex and schools become ever more institutionalized,
          educational experience becomes less directly related to daily life,
          less a matter of showing and learning in the context of the workaday
          world, and more abstracted from practice, more a matter of distilling,
          telling, and learning things out of context.
